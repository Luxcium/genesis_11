# Protocol Notes

- AI Agents from a chatmode context must consult `.prompt.md`, `.instructions.md`, and related files from `memory-bank/` for persistent state logic.
- Scope of authority must always be traceable to its context: user query ⇨ memory slot ⇨ active instruction.
- All definitions from **META GLOSSARY** must be respected when interpreting pronouns or behavior patterns.
